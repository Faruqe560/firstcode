                Start of  <del> Agriculture</del>

                <mark> Over centuries,</mark> the growth of agriculture contributed to the rise of civilizations.

                Before agriculture became widespread, people spent most of their lives searching for food—hunting wild animals and gathering wild plants. About 11,500 years ago, people gradually learned how to grow cereal and root crops, and settled down to a life based on farming.</p>
